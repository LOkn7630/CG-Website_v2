            <p>To ensure physical distancing does not mean social disconnection, Counselling Gurus and our IITian and
                doctor mentors have created a free mentorship program for JEE and NEET aspirants to stay connected to
                the details and information about exams and colleges during this time of physical distancing.</p>
            <p>If your JEE and NEET preparations have been impacted by COVID-19 and you are interested in using a safe
                and monitored mentorship by someone from your dream college then join our program for free.</p>
            <p>Every year in India, an average of 10-11 lakh new JEE aspirants and 14-15 lakh NEET aspirants register
                for entrance exam to get into a good college. The bad news is only half of them clear the cut-off of
                exam.</p>
            <p>And by the time of admissions, that number is cut to one-fourth. But, there are ways to increase your
                odds of getting into a good college. Working with a mentor has proven to be an indicator of success.</p>
